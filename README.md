### RISC-V MYTH Workshop ðŸš€

Welcome to my learning journey through the **RISC-V MYTH Workshop by **VSD and Redwood EDA**.

This repository documents my day-by-day progress as I explore the fundamentals of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), write assembly code, and design my own pipelined RISC-V CPU using **TL-Verilog** and **Makerchip**.
